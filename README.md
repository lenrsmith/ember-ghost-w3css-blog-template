# empress-blog-w3css-blog-template

This is a template designed to work with [empress-blog](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog)
and is an implementation of the free [W3CSS Blog Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_blog.htm).

You do not need to be a web developer to be able to use this system. You just write markdown files
and the rest of the work is performed by EmberJS' build system.

## Quick Start

```sh
npm init ember-app super-blog

cd super-blog

npx ember install empress-blog empress-blog-w3css-blog-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

**Note:** you need `npm@6.1` or later run this quick start. You can update with `npm install -g npm@latest` or check the [official docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm)
