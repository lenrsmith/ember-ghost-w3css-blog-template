# empress-blog-w3css-blog-template

This is a template designed to work with [empress-blog](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog)
and is an implementation of the free [W3CSS Blog Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_blog.htm).

For more information on how to use this system [read the empress-blog
documentation](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog/blob/master/README.md) but if you want to
get started straight away, try the quick start below.

You do not need to be a web developer to be able to use this system. You just write markdown files
and the rest of the work is performed by EmberJS' build system.
